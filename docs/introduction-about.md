In [the last chapter](preamble-about) some basic problems, existing solutions and basic principles were discussed.
After reading it, you should have a better idea about whether Hyrest is the best choice for you.
Furthermore it hopefully gave you some insights about how to roughly structure your project.

This chapter will dive deeper into Hyrest's approach and give some general advises about implementing a project with Hyrest.

1. After learning about other existing solutions, this section will explain **[Hyrest's approach](introduction-hyrests-approach)** for bridging the gap between your sub-projects.
2. Instead of providing a scaffolding preset or a boilerplate, Hyrest will provide you with **[architectural inspirations](introduction-architectural-inspirations)** for structuring your project.
3. Hyrest itself is mostly a framework for bridging the gap between your backend and frontend. Suggested **[companion technologies](introduction-companion-technologies)** which are tested to work well together with Hyrest can make your stack complete.
4. Finally, some **[examples](introduction-examples)** will be linked.
