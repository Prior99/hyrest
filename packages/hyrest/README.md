Hyrest is a hybrid REST framework for both the client and the server.

The idea is to define routes using decorators and use them to both serve the REST endpoint
and call them from the frontend. When developing both server and client in the same repository
or sharing a common library with all endpoints between the both, a call to a REST endoint
is transparent, type-safe and as easy calling a method.
